                Redlining was a 1930’s-era federal practice of delineating city areas by their return on investment, which often would result in banks refusing loans and mortgages to residents of ‘at-risk’ neighborhoods. To create these maps, the Home Owner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC), a government sponsored corporation created as a result of the New Deal, surveyed 239 cities and graded neighborhoods based on racial and ethnic buildup and average household income. Due to racial prejudices during the 1930’s, predominantly white neighborhoods were generally given higher grades while neighborhoods with more racial diversity received lower grades. Once these maps were created, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the organization which took over HOLC, used the maps in order to determine who could apply for and receive mortgages or loans. As substantially more mortgages were accepted in the higher grade areas than the lower graded areas, this created a wealth disparity between neighborhoods.

                    EFFECTS OF REDLINING
                </div>
                <div class="textcontent">
                    The term “redlining” refers to the red, D-grade, areas that marked certain neighborhoods as “unfit for investment”. On the other hand, green sectors (A grade) indicated new areas ideal for investment, blue sectors (B grade) were settled areas of adequate grade, and yellow sectors (C grade) meant some degree of undesirability. Though redlining is no longer a modern practice, its effects are still evident in society today. Today, redlined areas generally house more residents of color and have lower annual incomes than primarily white, high-income blue and green areas.
                    <br>The areas that were marked as red zones in the 1930’s still feel the effects today. They remain areas majoritally populated by lower-class individuals and block upward social and economic mobility. As the population has changed over the years, the poorer class was indirectly forced, due to redlining practices, to stay in these areas. Since the lower class was primarily made up of people of color and other minorities, these zones and neighborhoods have become segregated not only by economic and social class, but by race as well.

                    REDLINING AND RACE
                </div>
                <div class="textcontent">
                    One of the biggest effects of redlining was the unequal investment of capital into various communities throughout San Francisco. The redlining maps made it clear to local banks and financial institutions throughout the city where their money would be best spent.
                    <br> In addition to being the most desirable areas to live, green zones were seen as prime locations for investment due to its high white populations, increasing the values of local residents’ homes and hence their wealth. On the other hand, due to the racial buildup of relatively low income residents, redlined areas were seen as undesirable to investment in, causing property values to remain low. This disinvestment led to poverty and a lack of social mobility, which made life tougher for residents in redlined areas. Consequently, a large divide between racial communities, both financially and socially, was established. Furthermore, disinvestment in redlined areas was a self-perpetuating phenomenon in which disinvested communities continued to lack investment for many years for the same reason they never got it.
                    <br> In modern times, redlines areas have been receiving large amounts of private funding, which has improved these segregated communities. However, in many cases, the new influx of capital has forced out the established residents in these communities and gentrified areas with a higher cost of living. Much of this displacement is caused by large amounts of evictions around the city; most notably conducted through the Ellis Act. This legislation allows owners to evict their tenants in order to close or retire a building, forcing people out of their low cost rent-controlled units to make way for the construction of higher-priced luxury apartments. As a result, the cost of living has increased in these areas, making life unaffordable for its original residents and forcing them to seek more affordable areas outside of San Francisco. The evicted tenants are replaced by high-wage earners who can afford the increased price of living in these areas, resulting in the gentrification of these previously redlined areas.

                    REDLINING AND FORECLOSURES
                </div>
                <div class="textcontent">
                    Because redlined areas were normally last to receive investment decades after the boundaries were set, the demand for property in these areas was lower than that in other areas. In recent decades, investors such as local banks and financial institutions have realized the potential for “flipping” units in redlined areas to create lucrative profits. They have driven large amounts of investment to these areas, evicting previous residents and replacing downtrodden buildings with luxury condos. Because property values were low due to perpetual disinvestment, these investments reaped high profits. However, in order to “flip” units, it was first necessary to remove the poor and largely minority residents in residing within. Foreclosures on high-interest loans to residents of redlined areas and no-fault evictions via recent laws like the Ellis Act provided pathways for landlords and investors to “reset” redlined areas in order for redevelopment. Hence, more residents are displaced in yellow and red grade areas. They are often forced out of their own neighborhoods without the financial ability to settle anywhere else within San Francisco. On the other hand, the economic stability of white, middle-class residents and the low flipping potential of these areas have prevented foreclosures or evictions in green or blue areas. As a result, in recent years, redlined areas have been much more affected by waves of foreclosures, evictions, which has led to concomitant redevelopment and gentrification.

                    Foreclosure takes place when one fails to pay for their mortgaged properties, which leads to banks and the government to take control of those properties. Because minorities are most at risk of foreclosure, the positive relationship between foreclosure and race, according to From Foreclosures to Re-Redlining, eventually leads to the displacement of minorities and strengthens the idea of gentrification by promoting the state’s loaning policy. High-cost loans were concentrated in neighborhoods of color, while low-cost prime loans were more likely to be given to non-minority neighborhoods. As a result, unsustainable loans lead to foreclosure and re-redlining. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has confirmed that “African Americans and Latinos in California had less access to federally regulated bank lenders and greater access to mortgage brokers and independent mortgage companies”. Minorities such as African American and Latinos are forced to turn to high-interest lending plans in order to purchase properties; high-cost loans which targeted minorities contributed to two-third of the foreclosure in California.
                    <br> Overall, the process of foreclosure distances the wealthy and working class. Foreclosure has prevented the value of properties from failing and has discouraged minorities and the poor to possess properties. Areas with lower costs are purchased to become developed into luxurious entertainments, apartments and offices. As gentrification is introduced to fit the upper classes, re-redlining impacts areas where residents can barely resist to foreclosures. At the same time, local banks’ massive mortgage and loan denials discriminate against people of color who want to “revitalize” their community in the neighborhood.
